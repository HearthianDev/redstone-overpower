# Redstone overpower

This mod adds a bunch of redstone-related blocks to automate more aspects of the game and improve some other doable
stuff like logical gates or coder/decoders.

There sure are a lot of mods that adds some of these blocks but the goal of this mod is to keep it as vanilla as
possible while gathering all theese functionalitites in one mod. 

Ideas I've been gathering (but could be discard if not useful enough):
- Block placer
- Block breaker
- Movable inventory
- One-block logical gates and memory states
- Coder-decoder
- Better randomiser
- Wireless signal
- Filtered hopper
- Crop growth sensor
- Inventory observer
- Extended redstone strength
- Sticky iron chains (moved together when pulled/pushed)
